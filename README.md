## Purpose

PyQInt is a Python package for calculating one- and two-electron integrals as
encountered in electronic structure calculations. Since integral evaluation can
be quite computationally intensive, they are programmed in C++ and connected to
Python using Cython.

## Documentation

PyQInt comes with detailed documentation and examples, which can be found
at https://pyqint.imc-tue.nl.
