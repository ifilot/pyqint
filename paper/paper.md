# Summary

PyQInt is a teaching-oriented Hartree-Fock implementation in Python that
emphasizes clarity and transparency, exposing all matrices and algorithmic
steps—including molecular integrals over Gaussian basis functions, SCF
procedures with DIIS, orbital localization, and geometry optimization—to help
students explore and understand the foundations of electronic structure theory.
